## Article Overview

This page summarizes a quantitative synthesis on **induced leaf tannins** as a plant defense. We evaluate how often and how strongly tannins increase after herbivory or simulated damage, contrasting **woody vs. non‑woody plants**.

For comprehensive methods and results, please refer to our study:
