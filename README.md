## Article Overview

This page summarizes a quantitative synthesis on **induced leaf tannins** as a plant defense. We evaluate how often and how strongly tannins increase after herbivory or simulated damage, contrasting **woody vs. non‑woody plants**. Using log response ratios (lnRR) compiled across published experiments, we test moderators including tannin type (condensed vs. hydrolysable vs. total), leaf type and maturity, induction method (herbivore, chemical, artificial), herbivory intensity, and the timing of treatment and measurement.

For comprehensive methods and results, please refer to our study:

> **"Induced leaf tannins are common in woody plants, but evidence is limited in non‑woody plants."**
